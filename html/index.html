                    <p>It's been three years since we met and through those years, we had good memories together. I know that it is not always sunshine in our relationship, we have our own personal struggles as we go along the way. We have doubts, fear that maybe things might not work out. I know I have shortcomings in our relationship, sorry if sometimes I made you feel alone and unappreciated.</p>
                    <p>I wanted you to know that I always think about you and that everything that I do now is for our future. Thank you so much for staying with me, I know that you are having a hard time to especially on your career, but always remember that I am here to support you in whatever you want to do. If you need help, I am always here.</p>
                    <p>We still have a long way to go, but I know it will be all worth it. I love you so much and I hope that I can spend the rest of my life with you forever.</p>
